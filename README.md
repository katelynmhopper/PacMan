# pacmen
Factory for making pacmen
You are given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. 
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable. 

## How to run 
The code for creating and moving the pacmen are in the index.html file where you can see the complete code. Try to come up with the solution on your own and then take the code and see what you can do with it. 

## Roadmap of future improvements 
Initially I didn't have them changing directions when they hit one of the sides but I was able to update the code so it does change direction and the mouth moves. In the future I would like to work on styling the file maybe the background color or styling the buttons. I also would like to play around with the boundaries to keep them in a defined area rather then just the page.
